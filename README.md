<h1><b>#FACELY</</b></h1>
FACELY is a collaborative project by Abhiraj, Jaskaran, and Versha, developed as part of our Software Configuration Management (SCM) course. This project aims to bridge classroom concepts with real-world application development, focusing on AI-powered facial recognition. It emphasizes teamwork, code quality, version control, and problem-solving, while adhering to best practices in modern software development.

🚀 Project Overview
FACELY is an intelligent facial recognition system that enables users to upload a photo for identity verification or recognition. Using AI and computer vision techniques, the system analyzes facial features and compares them to a database of stored images.

🔍 How the App Works
📤 User Photo Upload
Users upload their image through the web interface.

🧠 Face Detection
The system detects faces in the uploaded image using OpenCV or deep learning-based models.

🧬 Feature Extraction
Facial features are extracted and converted into vector embeddings using AI models.

🔗 Face Matching & Recognition
The embeddings are compared with those in the database to identify or verify individuals.

📲 Result Display
The app displays the identity if a match is found, or returns an "Unknown" status if no match exists.
