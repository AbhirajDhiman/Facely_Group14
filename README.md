📌 Class Group Project This repository contains the collaborative work of Abhiraj, Jaskaran, and Versha for a class group project. The goal of this project is to apply our classroom learning to a real-world-style application, emphasizing teamwork, code quality, and problem-solving. 


🚀 Project Overviw
FACELY is an intelligent facial recognition system that allows users to upload a photo for identity verification or recognition. By leveraging AI and computer vision, the system analyzes facial features and compares them to a database of stored images.

🔎 Practical Use Cases
👨‍💼 In an organization:
Want to check all events or security footage where a specific employee appears? Upload their photo and FACELY will retrieve all instances across the dataset.

🎉 At a function or event:
Looking for all pictures where you were captured during a college fest or corporate event? Just upload your image to find all related photos.

🛠️ In a hackathon or team project:
Need to gather all images you're featured in for a report or social post? FACELY makes it simple—upload one photo, and it fetches the rest.

🔍 How the App Works.
📤 User Photo Upload
Users upload an image via the web interface.

🧠 Face Detection
The system detects faces in the uploaded image.

🧬 Feature Extraction
Facial features are extracted.

🔗 Face Matching & Recognition
The system compares the uploaded face embeddings with those stored in the database to find matches.

📲 Result Display
The application displays the matched identity and retrieves all corresponding images. If no match is found, it returns an "Unknown" status.
