This repository contains the collaborative work of Abhiraj, Jaskaran, and Versha for a class group project in Software Configuration Management (SCM). The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered face recognition application, applying our classroom learning to a real-world scenario. Our focus is on teamwork, code quality, version control, and problem-solving while implementing best practices in software development.

Project Overview
The AI Face Recognizer is an application that allows users to upload their photo, which is then processed using AI-powered facial recognition. The system extracts facial features and compares them against stored images to identify or verify individuals.

How the App Works
User Photo Upload – Users upload their image via the app.

Face Detection – The system detects faces in the image using OpenCV or deep learning models.

Feature Extraction – The facial features are converted into embeddings using AI models.

Face Matching & Recognition – The extracted features are compared against a database of stored images.

Result Display – The app returns the identity match or an "unknown" status if no match is found
